# Pythonic Thoughts Snippets

Hello,

I created the **Pythonic Thoughts Snippets** series out of the need to share my connection with the code I write, how my vision and style evolve, how my mindset for code writing shapes with time in a continuous quest towards writing more maintainable, easy to read, robust and beautiful code. I hope you find these little articles of interest and also share your comments. These posts are the result of many online and book readings, discussions with others and hours spent staring at the code. Please consider I am not a purely computational person, I am a biochemist passionate about coding that have learnt my way through this beautiful discipline.

You can find in this repository the code snippets, and in my blog the [discussion posts series](https://viviendomochileros.com/2019/08/16/pythonic-thoughts-snippets-series/).
