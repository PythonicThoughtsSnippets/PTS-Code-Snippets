# Pythonic Thoughts Snippets

Hello,

I created the **Pythonic Thoughts Snippets** series out of the need to share my connection with the code I write, how my vision and style evolve, how my mindset for code writing shapes with time, in a continuous quest towards writing more maintainable, easy to read, robust and beautiful code. I hope you find these little articles of interest and share you comments, they are the result of many readings online and books, discussion with others and staring at the code :P. Please consider I am not a purely computational person, I am a biochemist passionate about coding that have learnt his way through this beautiful discipline.

You can find in this repository the code snippets, and in my blog the discussion post about it.
